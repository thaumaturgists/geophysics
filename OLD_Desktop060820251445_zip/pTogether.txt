### Reassembling the Files in Git Bash

To reassemble the split files back into a single file, you can use the `cat` command:

> Make sure you are in the folder with the file
```bash
cd path-to-this-file
```

> use "ls" to see the files
```bash
ls
```
part_aa part_ab part_ac part_ad part_ae

1. **Run the `cat` command:**
   ```bash
   cat part_* > OLD_Desktop060820251445.zip
   ```
   - This command concatenates all files starting with `part_` into a new file called `OLD_Desktop060820251445.zip`.

### Checking the hash
To make sure it is undamaged

> To check the SHA-384 hash of a file using Git Bash, you can use the shasum command with the -a option to specify the hash algorithm. Hereâ€™s the command you would use:
```bash
shasum -a 384 OLD_Desktop060820251445.zip
```

OLD_Desktop060820251445.zip: SHA384
