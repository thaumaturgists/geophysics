### Reassembling the Files in Git Bash

To reassemble the split files back into a single file, you can use the `cat` command:

1. **Run the `cat` command:**
   ```bash
   cat part_* > OLD_Desktop060820251445.zip
   ```
   - This command concatenates all files starting with `part_` into a new file called `OLD_Desktop060820251445.zip`.


OLD_Desktop060820251445.zip: SHA384
